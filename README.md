# Data-Visualization-Exercise-Cereal-
This is an exercise on visualizing data. I used cereal rating data to generate my visualizations.

I used data in regards to sugar content and fiber content to create a visual analysis on how each of those variables affected the cereal rating. Both subplots were generated using MATLAB coding.
